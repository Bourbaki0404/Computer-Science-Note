# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE

In this article, I will list all the learning resources for Computer Architecture that I find helpful.

## Courses

- Digital Design and Computer (ETH) Architecture 

This course introduces the digital circuits, microarchitecture and computer architecture. It also contains a variety of advanced topics, from the Out-of-Order processor, branch predictor, precise exception to GPU and on-chip network.

Advantage: processor, branch predictor

Drawbacks: I/O and Bus are seemingly neglected.

## Textbooks

- *Essentials of Computer Architecture*

Introduces the idea of Bus abstraction.

- *The Cache Memory Book*

Introduces the Cache-CPU and Cache-Bus interface.

- *Memory Systems - Cache, Dram, Disk*

Fabulous book on Memory architecture.

- *Introduction to computing systems*

Introduces the basic of I/O with easy examples.

- *Computer Architecture - A Quantitive Approach*

Best book in computer architecture. However, little hardware implementation is involved.

- *Modern Processor Design*

Great book on modern processor.
